# Started Building MERN Tinder Clone App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project contains the following functionalities:
Header with logoicon, profile icon and forum (Material Ui has been used)<br>
Tinder cards section conatins react-tinder-card<br>
Firebase for frontend<br>
heruko for backend<<br>

## During the project I got issue regarding Material UI as I am using React-18.0.0 
tried: npm install --legacy-peer-deps @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled <br>
remember --legacy-peer-deps is important <br><br>

## While working with NodeJS:
First Problem appear with nodemon, tried the following steps:<br><br>
 - First search and run PowerShell as administrator <br>
 - Run : Get-ExecutionPolicy
 - Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted<br>
It should be unrestricted <br>
